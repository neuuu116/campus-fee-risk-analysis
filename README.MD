# Sustainable Campus Fee Risk Analysis System

This project is a Python + MySQL based backend system developed as part of my first hackathon.

## Problem Statement
Educational institutions face delayed fee payments which increase administrative workload and student stress.

## Solution
The system stores student fee data in a MySQL database and uses Python logic to:
- Calculate pending fees
- Categorize students into risk levels
- Suggest ethical and non-harassing payment plans

## Tech Stack
- Python
- MySQL
- VS Code

## Features
- Rule-based risk classification
- Ethical payment recommendations
- SQL-Python integration

## Future Scope
- Automated reminders (Email/SMS)
- Admin & student dashboards
- ML-based risk prediction

## Note
Database credentials are hidden for security reasons.
